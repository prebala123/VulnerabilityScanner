# Vulnerability Scanner
This project aims to analyze the given Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) files which contain security vulnerabilities of all components of projects. Each SBOM file contains information about multiple vulnerabilities which include its id, component, severity, current version, and fix version. The project feeds the SBOM files into the Chat GPT API and uses AI in order to parse and return an output which contains all of the information in a usable format. The code then outputs all of the fixable vulnerabilities along with the top 5 most severe component issues that need to be addressed. <br> <br>
The project can be run with these flags in the command line: <br>
-a [API key] <br>
-m [Chat GPT Model for "gpt-3.5-turbo" or "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"] <br>
-b [True or False for if base images vulnerabilities should be included, default True] <br>
-j [Folder for JSON files] <br>
